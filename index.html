      <p>
        Saint Petersburg, formerly known as Petrograd (1914-1924) and later
        Leningrad (1924-1991), is the second-largest city in Russia. It is
        situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the
        Baltic Sea, with a population of roughly 5.4 million residents. Saint
        Petersburg is the fourth-most populous city in Europe after Istanbul,
        Moscow and London, and the world's northernmost city of more than 1
        million residents.The city was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on 27 May
        1703 on the site of a captured Swedish fortress, and was named after
        apostle Saint Peter.

          <h3>Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood</h3>
          <p>
            The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is one of the main
            attractions in St. Petersburg, drawing crowds to its ornately
            decorated onion domes and the stunning mosaics housed within.
            Alexander III commissioned the construction of the church in 1883 as
            a tribute to his slain father, Alexander II, who was assassinated on
            this site by a group of revolutionaries.

          <h3>St. Isaac's Cathedral</h3>
          <p>
            The construction of St. Isaac's Cathedral was ordered by Alexander I
            in the early 1800s. This neoclassical marvel was finally completed
            in 1858 after 40 years of construction. St. Isaac's has an
            interesting history: it survived Nazi shelling in World War II and
            even briefly served as a museum of atheism under the Soviet regime.

          <h3>Hermitage Museum and the Winter Palace</h3>
          <p>
            Catherine the Great founded the Hermitage Museum in 1764 as a place
            to house her private art collection. The main museum complex
            comprises six buildings, including the Winter Palace, which was the
            home of the czars for almost 200 years. It finally opened to the
            public in 1852, and since then has been one of the largest and most
            interesting museums in the world.
